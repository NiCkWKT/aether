// Package model defines the data structures mapped from the Graph Workflow Protocol (aether/v1).
package model

// Phase represents the execution phase of a workflow or task.
//
// State machine for all task types (leaf task, DAG container, Loop container):
//
//	Created → Ready → Running → (terminal)
//	                     ↓
//	                  Suspended → (Resume) → Running → ...
//
// Created: task has been persisted to the store but the engine has not yet
//
//	decided to activate it (dependencies not met, concurrency limit, etc.).
//
// Ready: the engine has committed to execute this task.
//
//	For a leaf task this means Broker.Dispatch() has been called.
//	For a container (DAG/Loop) this means its first child leaf has been dispatched.
//
// Running: execution has actually begun.
//
//	For a leaf task this means OnTaskStarted has been called by the broker.
//	For a container this means its first child leaf has transitioned to Running.
//
// Suspended: the executor returned ExecCodeSuspended. The task is paused,
//
//	waiting for an external Resume() call. Only leaf tasks enter this state.
