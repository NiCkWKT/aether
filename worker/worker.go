// Package worker defines the worker registration and discovery abstraction for aether.
//
// WorkerRegistry is an independent interface that manages worker lifecycle
// (registration, unregistration, discovery) separately from task lifecycle
// (which is managed by broker.TaskBroker).
//
// The separation of concerns:
//   - TaskBroker:     task dispatch, cancellation, fetching, completion
//   - WorkerRegistry: worker identity, capabilities, heartbeat, schema propagation
//
// Implementations must be safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
package worker

	"context"
	"errors"

	"github.com/BabySid/aether/wire"
)

// ErrNotFound is returned when a worker is not found in the registry.
var ErrNotFound = errors.New("worker not found")

// Registry manages worker registration and discovery.
//
// In a distributed deployment, workers call Register at startup to announce
// their identity and capabilities (supported executor types + schemas).
// The master (or broker) uses ListByExecutorType to find workers capable of
// handling a given task, enabling type-based routing.
//
// Implementations must be safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

	// Heartbeat reports that a worker is still alive.

	// Implementations should treat this as idempotent.
	// The registry may use heartbeat absence to detect stale workers and remove them.
